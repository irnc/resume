Pavel Zubkou
============

---

Full-stack JavaScript developer. I do architect systems and platforms, implement applications using web technologies.

DevOps tools in toolbox. Using Node.js and React recently; previously PHP and jQuery.

Looking for opportunities in digital platforms engineering. Learning data analysis and visualization, specifically R and d3. Inspired by data journalism.

---

Education
---------

2006-2011
:   **BSc, Computer Science**; Grodno State University (Belarus)

    *Specialization: software engineering.*

    I begun programming professionally in year 2003. In 2006 I went to university to advance my skills and to get deeper knowledge in a field which has been my passion from childhood.

2013-2017 (ongoing)
:   **Senior Lecturer**; Grodno State University (Belarus)

    The best way to learn is to teach. For the last four years I lectured and practiced with students in _modern technologies of web-application development_.

    For all four years focus of my course was on technologies fundamental to the Web; on that foundation, we practiced JavaScript for both server-side and client-side development.

Experience
----------

**Lead Engineer, Head of Node.js Development at _\*instinctools EE Labs_**

I joined \*instinctools in 2015 as a Lead Engineer and since then have worked with all kinds of JavaScript.

Currently I am _leading a group_ of six people. Other than doing client work, we do learn together and develop proof-of-concepts using new and aspiring technologies.

Worked for clients ranging from startups to big enterprises. Deployed projects to cloud clusters, single instances, mobile devices and set-top boxes.

If asked to highlight a single project from these years, I would recall information system for construction industry we developed and deployed in 2015-2016. It was a challenging project in all matters, among other things here is what we done on technical side:

- orchestrated ETL process from legacy Oracle database to MongoDB and Elasticsearch using Pentaho DI and Apache Kafka
- designed and developed APIs consumed by web application and enterprise partners (using Node.js)
- implemented business logic and reporting as modules reusable between client and server
    - in which we done _business math_ where legacy rules and _calculation errors_ should be respected and reproduced
- developed single-page web application using Ember.js
    - designed and implemented service for server-side rendering (it was a big deal in 2015)
- practiced DevOps using Docker, Jenkins and Ansible

It was a challenge to setup and scale code review and test automation practices on a team of about 20 developers. We done it successfully, and I learned a lot about project management in the process. We practiced Scrum and done two-week sprints with bi-weekly demos to the client. It was a pleasure to see a happy product owner after each demo, needless to say how that feedback motivated the team.

**Lead Engineer at _Intelligent AS_**

_2012-2015_ small business / startups

Lead development on document management solution and a custom CRM solution for regional development offices.

Modernized legacy system, written mainly in PHP. Done greenfield product development with Node.js on backend and Angular on frontend. Challenges: transition to cloud, API design, ETL processes, integrating legacy and new systems, managing team between Norway and Belarus.

From around November 2012 I switched my main practice to Node.js and never looked back to PHP.

**PhoneGap craftsman at _Yangutu Inc_**

_2011-2012_ startup

Implemented a mobile website and an application for iOS & Android devices from a single codebase. Web application was build using jQuery Mobile and deployed as mobile app using PhoneGap.

Part-time doing PHP development for related server-side components.

Fall 2011 was the first time I worked with Node.js and WebSocket to implement real-time messaging. There was times when WebSocket crashed Safari browser on iPhone 3GS. But I was happy to work with JavaScript on server.

**Software Developer at _Itransition_**

_2005-2011_

Custom web application development (mainly B2C applications) on Zend Framework and Magento on server-side and jQuery and Ext JS on front-end.

A lot happened during my employment here. In 2006 I went to university and graduated from it in 2011.

**Junior Developer at _Terabyte Solutions_**

_2003_

This was my first paid job as a programmer. I implemented minor features on custom e-commerce solutions. It was great, I was 15 years old back then, still studying at school. For me this proved that computers and programming isn't just hobby, but a real opportunity.

I was advised to pursue learning Perl and Java also, which I done, but I barely practiced these languages.

PHP 4.3 was just released, jQuery wasn't a thing yet, we had been struggling with inconsistencies in browser implementations, but created rich UI with client-side logic nevertheless.

It was long time ago, now only Wayback Machine remembers [Terabyte Solutions][tera.by].

Technical Experience
--------------------

DevOps
:   Makefiles, Ansible, Jenkins, Docker, Terraform.

    Looking into Kubernetes and Mesos.

Cloud
:   Deployed applications to AWS and Azure (compute and auto scaling).

    Used Kinesis, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, ECS and ECR, Route 53, CloudWatch, IAM, SES, SQS, SNS.

GNU/Linux
:   Used on desktop as main OS from around 2002, just for curiosity. Started with Red Hat 8.

    Sometime in 2003 I compiled GNU/Linux system from scratch under [LFS project][lfs] guidance, and used if for a few years as main OS on my desktop. Using it on a daily basis, and solving a lot of issues in the process, given me a great hands-on experience. It taught me to bisect hard problems and solve them systematically.

    Since then I moved to Debian and Ubuntu for production setup.

Databases
:   My first database was MySQL, I used it a lot. Knowing SQL, I played a little
    bit with PostgreSQL and SQLite too.

    Nowadays I use MongoDB and Elasticsearch a lot. Redis plays instrumental
    role, while I am looking into using it more.

    Used RabbitMQ as queue on microservices.

    CouchDB intrigued me a lot, so I deployed it in a side project to understand
    it better.

    I have worked with RethinkDB, ArangoDB and Neo4j scratching the basics.

Big Data
:   Used some tools, e.g. Apache Kafka, Hadoop. Looking into Spark and Scala.

    Setup data pipeline using Amazon Kinesis (working around a lot of issues at
    AWS side), used Kibana and Quicksight, but I want to have more real
    practice with Apache stack.

    Created analytic dashboards in Kibana and Google Analytics for marketing
    team.

Programming Languages
:   **JavaScript:** For me JavaScript is a lingua franca, I understand and use
    this language a lot. I could use it to program browser, server, utility
    script or Arduino device.

    During my career path I used vanilla JavaScript in 2003, jQuery, Prototype.js,
    Ext JS, Backbone, Angular, Ember and React. Currently looking into Vue and
    Cycle.js out of curiosity.

    Node.js came as a surprise to me in 2011 and a great tool since then. I used
    Express, hapi and koa frameworks in production deployments. Played with
    myriad other frameworks and packages.

    Babel + Webpack helps me a lot on all kinds of projects.

:   **Flow:** Not a language by itself, but a static type checker for JS.

    I use Flow since January 2017, and it changed a lot how I think about code.
    It made me curious about OCaml and ReasonML, so I started learning former
    with the goal to understand Flow codebase.

:   **PHP:** I used it for too long to forget :)

    In 2004 I participated in Zend's PHP 5 Contest which was organized by Zend
    to showcase new features of yet to be released PHP 5. My _online price
    comparison_ application was [among prizewinners, ranked 21][my21] out of 99
    finalists.

    Only in 2011 I switched from PHP to Node.js.

:   Basic knowledge of **R**, **Python**, **C**, **Java** and even **x86 assembly**.

    Long time ago written some C and C++. Done small things using Java.

    Once implemented project using C# and ASP.NET MVC.

    Once grokked GRUB boot loader while studying x86 assembly.
